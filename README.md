# Financial Status Service UI (Calculator only) #

N.B. This repo is archived as there is no longer a requirement for the component.

## Overview ##

UI project to add basic interface to an API connected to perform threshold and date calculations which can help Tier 2,4 & 5 applicants prove their financial status to government far quicker and easier than before.

## Tech ##

- Node
- Angular
- Cucumber JS & Gherkin

The frontend is an Angular 1 project.

Userbase is a known limited quantity of users internal to The Home Office and access to Chrome as a browser for those users is confirmed, it has therefore been determined that supporting other browsers is unnessesary - however web standards should be adheared to.

This project has a Node JS backend soley for the purposes of relaying asynchronous requests to the API which exists in its own project, this is one single Node file `server.js`.

## install ##

    // Checkout the project
    git clone git@github.com:UKHomeOffice/pttg-fs-calc-ui.git `

    // move into cloned directory
    cd pttg-fs-calc-ui

    // install modules
    npm install
    
    // generate the compiled/minified resources e.g. js, css
    gulp
    
    // start the project
    npm start

## Specification ##

The specification of this project is primarily via Feature files using a BDD approach.

These features are written in Gherkin and can be consumed by CucumberJS to run tests against those specifications.

## Tests ##

    // To run BDD feature file tests
    npm run test:bdd
    
    // to run Unit tests
    npm run test:unit
    
    // to run all tests
    npm run test:all
   
Tests are run using Chrome in Headless mode, you need an up-to-date version of Chrome to do this.

Tests may be run in Chrome with a browser window by changing the `var headless = true` in the config section of the `features/support/world.js`

### BDD Base image ###

When running the tests in Docker the image built by Dockerfile_test is used. This installs all dependent node modules not just prod ones.

This Docker image is based on a pttg shared image `pttg-bdd-base`. 
`pttg-bdd-base` is based on the current  LTS version of node and the latest stable chrome version for chrome headless testing.

Therefore to test against the latest version of node just rebuild the pttg-bdd-base project and the latest stable version of Chrome will be baked into the image.

Furthermore, if updating the node version in this project it is best to also update the node version in `pttg-bdd-base` which is used when running the BDD tests.
