Feature: Add feedback header and 'feedback’ hyperlink to the tool

#    SO THAT I can collect feedback about the Financial Status Check Tool service
#    AS A Proving Things Team
#    WOULD LIKE A ‘feedback’ banner and hyperlink to be placed directly under all page headers

  Background:
    Given the api health check response has status 200


  Scenario: Feedback banner on each page
    Then the service displays the following page content
      | Beta messsage | This is a new service – your feedback will help us to improve it. |
    And the service has the following links
      | feedback link | feedback | mailto:financialstatus@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk |

####

#        When the service displays the following page banner 'This is a new service - your feedback will help us improve it'
#        Then the word feedback is a mailto hyperlink

#
#    Scenario: Hyperlink generates blank email with a recipient of financialstatus@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk
#        When the feedback hyperlink in the banner is selected
#        Then a blank email is opened with a pre-populated 'to' recipient of financialstatus@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk
#        And has a pre-populated title of ‘Check financial status service feedback’
#
#
#    Scenario: Return the user to the page they were on
#        Given the feedback link in the banner is selected
#        When the user sends the email
#        Then the user returns to the page that they were on in the service
